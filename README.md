# spinnaker-oss-setup

Spinnaker development environment setup.

This, combined with my [dotfiles](https://github.com/robzienert/dotfiles) and a Netflix-internal overlay will completely setup a new laptop. Neat.

You'll need homebrew, I've only written this for OSX so far, but can easily be linux'd as well.

1. Clone into `~/.spinnaker-setup`
1. `$ ./install.sh <github_username>`
